**Tools used:** PostgreSQL (PgAdmin 4) <br>
**Dataset:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Netflix's content catalog using SQL. The dataset contains information about TV shows and movies, including details such as title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, and more. Through various SQL queries, we explore trends and insights about the content available on Netflix.

**Note:** While this was a guided project, I made modifications to several queries to enhance their accuracy where I deemed necessary.

## :pushpin: Key Insights:

1. **Content Distribution**: Comparison of the number of movies versus TV shows in the dataset.
2. **Rating Analysis**: Identification of the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
3. **Year-wise Content**: List of all movies released in a particular year.
4. **Popular Genres**: Exploration of the most common genres available.
5. **Country-based Analysis**: Insights into the countries producing the most content.

The project provides a foundation for understanding Netflixâ€™s content offerings using SQL queries for data extraction and analysis.
